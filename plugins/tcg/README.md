## Quick Start

### Initialize System
```bash
# Using new modular CLI
python cli.py init                   # Create database and load sets
python cli.py fetch_all             # Fetch all price history (with rate limiting)

# Using legacy interface (still supported)
python init_db.py                   # Create database
python load_groups.py               # Load Pokemon sets data
python testing.py fetch_all         # Fetch all price history
```

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# New CLI interface
python cli.py summary               # Show data status
python cli.py trends                # Price trends (last 30 days)
python cli.py analyze 624679        # Detailed analysis for specific product
python cli.py volume_summary        # Volume statistics by set

# Legacy interface (still supported)
python testing.py summary           # Show data status
python testing.py trends            # Price trends (last 30 days)
python testing.py analyze 624679    # Detailed analysis for specific product
```

### Generate Visualizations
```bash
python cli.py volume pokemon_volume.csv     # Export volume data
python visualize_volume.py                  # Create static charts
python interactive_charts.py                # Create interactive dashboard
```

### Advanced Analysis with New Modules
```python
from database import DatabaseManager
from data_collector import DataCollector
from data_manager import DataManager
import analysis

# Using new modular architecture
db = DatabaseManager()
collector = DataCollector(db)
manager = DataManager(db)

# Load and fetch data
manager.load_pokemon_sets_from_csv("pokemon_sets.csv")
collector.fetch_price_history_for_product(624679)

# Traditional analysis still works
data = analysis.get_time_series_by_product_id(624679)
trends = analysis.analyze_price_trends(624679, window_days=14)
analysis.export_to_csv(data, "my_analysis.csv")
```

## Command Line Interface

The system now provides two CLI options:

### New Modular CLI (`cli.py`)
The recommended interface with clean architecture:

**Setup:**
- `init` - Initialize database and load Pokemon sets
- `summary` - Show Pokemon sets and price history status

**Data Collection:**
- `fetch_one <id>` - Fetch price history for single product
- `fetch_all` - Fetch price history for all Pokemon sets
- `load_sets <csv_file>` - Load Pokemon sets from CSV

**Analysis:**
- `analyze <id> [window]` - Detailed product analysis
- `trends [id] [days]` - Show price trends
- `export <id> [file]` - Export time series to CSV
- `sets` - List all available Pokemon sets
- `recent [days]` - Show recent price activity

**Visualization:**
- `volume [file]` - Export volume data to CSV
- `volume_summary` - Show volume statistics by set

### Legacy CLI (`testing.py`)
Still supported for backward compatibility with identical commands:
- All the same commands as above
- Plus additional API testing functions
- Delegates to new modular system internally

Both interfaces provide the same functionality, with the new `cli.py` offering better organization and maintainability.

## Data Sources

- **TCGPlayer API**: `https://infinite-api.tcgplayer.com/price/history/{product_id}/detailed`
- **Pokemon Sets CSV**: Manually curated set information with product IDs
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between API requests (configurable)

## Output Files

- **`tcg.db`** - SQLite database with all price history
- **`pokemon_volume_chart.png`** - Static volume trend chart
- **`pokemon_volume_interactive.html`** - Interactive volume dashboard
- **`pokemon_dashboard.html`** - Comprehensive analysis dashboard
- **CSV exports** - Formatted data for external analysis tools

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for database, data collection, management, and CLI
- **Backward Compatibility**: All original function signatures preserved for existing code
- **Class-based Organization**: Each module uses classes for better encapsulation and reusability
- **Database**: SQLite with proper indexing and constraints via DatabaseManager
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with configurable delays in DataCollector
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints prevent duplicate entries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and missing data throughout all modules
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and batch processing for large datasets

### Module Dependencies
- `database.py` - Core database operations (no dependencies)
- `data_collector.py` - Depends on database.py
- `data_manager.py` - Depends on database.py  
- `cli.py` - Depends on all other modules
- Legacy files import from new modules for compatibility

This refactored architecture provides better maintainability, testability, and extensibility while preserving all existing functionality.
